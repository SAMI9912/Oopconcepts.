Step 1: 

-I login to my subexpert account 

Step 2: 

-I subscribe to course "Design Pattern"

Step 3: 

-Lab Task One is to go the webiste the link is provided already where we have to study OOP Concepts

Step 4: 

-First concept i study is Abstraction 
   -Data Hiding
   -Suppose you have to drive car buit not to know its internal working
-Second concept i study is Interface 
  -Achieve abstraction
  -BluePrint of Class
-Third COncept i study is Encapsulation
  -protect the internal concept of of class 
  -to implement encapsulation we have to make variables private
-Fourth concept i study is inheritence
   -parentc-child relationship
   -Multiple inheritence is not allowd in JAVA so we use interface concept here 
-Fifth concept i study is polymorphisam 
   -Declare same method with same name with differant characterstics (Method Overloading)
   -You can use the methods of parent class in child class also (Method OverRiding)

Now I learn the Abstraction , Aggregation and composition :

=>Aggregation : 
	-Has-A Relationshoip
	-relation with two classes and association with their object 
=>Association:
	-establishing a relationship between two unrelated classes
	-Two separate classes are associated through their objects
=>Composition:
	-Composition is a stricter form of aggregation. 
	-It occurs when the two classes you associate are mutually dependent and canâ€™t exist without each other.
